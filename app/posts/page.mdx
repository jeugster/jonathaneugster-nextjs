# Next.js is a powerful tool for optimizing static site generation 
## with full control over presentation and features. 
No need for costly licenses or proprietary hosting, it can run anywhere for next to nothing.

Active elements can be serverless, run on a client device, or on a server.

This website in particular has the following features:
1. Renders local markdown content to a static site
2. Server renders static pages only once and only when the page has new data
3. Preprocessing allows a minimal code base to accomplish compatibility, reliability, and accessibility.
4. Open source and source controlled means code is portable. 
5. Hosting can be local or migrate without trouble.

# About This Site
This Nextjs personal portfolio and blog is hosted on Netlify. Style is handled by Tailwind CSS. 

This stack allows non-technical team members to utilize familiar tools like a CMS with web interface or Google Tags while allowing developers total freedom.

The site is entirely static, uses open-source libraries, and is version controlled in git on github. Updates trigger generation of static files incrementally for only new and updated components. All public files are optimized on build for the fastest load on any device.

Third party tags are controlled through Google Tag Manager. Performance audits using Lighthouse. Analytics by Google Analytics. Builds fail on a11y error.
