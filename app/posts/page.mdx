### Next.js is a powerful tool for optimizing static site generation with full control over presentation and features. 
No need for costly licenses or proprietary hosting, it can run anywhere for next to nothing.

Active elements can be serverless, run on a client device, or on a server.

This website in particular has the following features:
1. Renders API data to a static site when new or changed data is detected
2. Server renders static pages only once and only when the page has new data
3. Preprocessing allows a minimal code base to accomplish compatibility, reliability, and accessibility.
4. Open source and source controlled means code is portable. Hosting can be local or migrate without trouble.
