No need for costly licenses or proprietary hosting, it can run anywhere.

Active elements can be serverless or dedicated.

1. Renders API data to a static site when new or changed data is detected
2. Server renders static pages only once and only when the page has new data
3. Preprocessing allows a minimal code base to accomplish compatibility, reliability, and accessibility.
4. Open source and source controlled means code is portable. Hosting can be local or migrate without trouble.
